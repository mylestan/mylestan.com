				if(txt == 'about')content = "<p>Hey, my name is Myles. I'm a 20 year-old student currently living in Waterloo, Ontario. I study Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo, which means I spend a lot of my time learning in various engineering disciplines, how they interact, and how to apply them to solve big problems in our world.</p><p>Thanks to the Waterloo's co-op program, I've had the opportunity to apply my passion for solving big problems while working for some of the fastest growing software companies in Canada, helping to revolutionize crucial industries such as healthcare and education. I'm looking forward to exploring other opportunities through which I can have a big impact on our world: change some lives, maybe even history.</p><p>This website is one of my pet projects. It's constantly under construction as I get through HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery; the usual. I hope to have it updated at least once a week. If you have some time, take a tour!</p>";
				if(txt == 'blog')content = "<p>I blog at <a href='http://www.taniard.tumblr.com' target='_blank'>taniard.tumblr.com</a>. Ultimately, I think blogging is a bit narcissistic, but in a good way. Through the process of attempting to share your identity with the world, you are forced to reflect, consciously learn about yourself, and grow.</p><p>Most of my posts are little snippets of information that I believe contribute to the betterment of myself as a person. Whether it's a quote from osho, article about eating healthy, or a music vid with sweet lyrics, I think all these pieces help us chip away at our identity, iteratively defining the person who we want to be.</p><p>That being said, I highly recommend you check out my blog. I think it'll help you get a better understanding of what makes me tick. I guarantee you will walk away a more knowledgeable, enlightened, or cultured human being. If not, let me know: I'm doing something seriously wrong.</p><p>Nerd Note: Eventually I'd like to do my own tumblr css template and integrate it right into my site, or make my page jekyll-based and blog within the wite, but external linking will have to do for now.</p>";
				if(txt == 'photos') content = "<p>I like to take photos! I got into photography at about 16. My mother gave me her old Pentax K1000, with which I fell in love. Photography lets you capture moments in time, but the addictive part is trying to capture everything else about that moment above and beyond the visual reference. Can you FEEL that moment? Great photos play all of your senses through one, and that's pretty awesome.</p><p>I take every possible opportunity to shoot. On top of my random excursion photos, you'll see portrait work, event photography, documentary content: whatever happened to come my way. Taking on a wide range of projects, aka throwing yourself into the deep end, makes learning a lot more fun.</p><p>You can find my photos on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/myles_tan' target='_blank'>Flickr</a>. Or, you can jump straight to my <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/myles_tan/collections/72157613311822800/' target='_blank'>photography portfolio set</a>.</p><p>I've also begun to throw together a more general porfolio of my work. It contains all kinds of creative projects that I've taken on, and aims to be a reference for my interest and proficency in design and creation as I search for more design-related work experience within engineering. It contains cool projects like my designs for the Engineering Society Novelties Store, my first Infographic, and the process of making my hand-crafted leather briefcase. Feel free to check it out <a href='http://www.projeqt.com/mylestan' target='_blank'>here</a>.";
				if(txt == 'resume') content = "<p>As I had mentioned, Waterloo's co-op program has given me some pretty amazing experiences out in the industry, learning and applying myself to help solve some really interesting problems. Out of the six co-op placements as part of our university degree, I have two more coming up: one in Fall of 2012, and the other in the Summer of 2013.</p><p>I'd like to spend them working with a group of bright, hard-working individuals trying to solve a big problem in our world. In previous terms I've focused on North-American healthcare and education, but I'd really like to explore new industries with wicked problems of their own (see my <a href='http://mylestan.com/resume/' target='_blank'>resume</a>).</p><p><strong>My Past</strong></p><p>My first work term was at a company called NexJ Systems Inc. in Toronto. I took a QA position and joined the Mobile team, testing the mobile version of their CRM applications. That's where I first interacted with their mobile consumer healthcare apps. My interest in healthcare software took off, and I ended up doing my work term report for the VP of Helath Solutions, analyzing core functionality behind health-based social networking sites.</p><p>Working directly under the VP of Health Solutions for my next term, I had the chance to get right into the thick of NexJ's market and product strategy, and I learned a lot about the US and Canadian Healthcare systems. I fell in love with the concept of mixing mobile technology and behavior change concepts to help do great things for the world. As a systems-thinker the best part was learning how everything fits into the big picture, and how simple consumer software connects to revolutionary changes in the North-American healthcare industry.</p><p>I spent my third term working at Desire2Learn as a Product Designer. I've always been a very creative and design oriented thinker, and working on UI/UX work was a blast. I also learned a lot about accessibility and usability requirements, as well as balancing business objectives and technical limitations with design. Since working at D2L, I've taken a strong interst in education from a high-level perspective, learning about fundamental problems in our established systems today, and how we can change them to more effectively grow as a society.</p><p>I returned to NexJ Systems for my fourth term to take on a Product Management position. I had the ability to shape entire product features, applying everything I had learned about software design and the industry. It was also a great opportunity to be the 'people-person', and I loved the more communicative and interactive role. I worked on some pretty fantastic software solutions, which solidified my passion for creating product that will help change the world.</p><p>Going forwards, I want to a) learn a lot, fast, and b) continue to do things that revolutionize the world around me. I've found my motivation and passions, and will continue to explore them. Finally, I can't wait to meet some great people along the way.</p>";

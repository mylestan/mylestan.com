            <h2>How to plant</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally, these plants are going to do better in medium to full light.</li>
                <li>Generally, these plants benefit greatly from cold moist stratification. Meaning get them on/in the ground in Dec/Jan if you want them to come up this spring.</li>
                <li>Generally, these plants need direct soil contact, e.g. plat them on/in bare dirt, not sprinkled over mulch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to plant</h2>
            <p>Generally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>these plants are going to do better in spots with medium to full sun. I would not plant them somewhere with low to no sun.</li>
                <li>thse seeds will need cold moist stratification. Meaning get them on/in the ground in Dec/Jan if you want them to come up this spring.</li>
                <li>these seeds will need direct soil contact to seed successfully, e.g. plant them on/in bare dirt, not sprinkled over mulch.</li>
            </ul>
